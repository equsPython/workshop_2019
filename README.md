# EQUS Python workshop 2019

*Tuesday, 28/01 to Friday 1/02*

This repository contains codes and supplementatry material for the EQUS Python workshop.
We cover a basic to advanced introduction to Python programming
and general software development techniques and practices (e.g. how to package, document,
test and distribute code, and how to work collaboratively on GitHub). Having covered this on the first
couple of days with plenty of hands-on tutorials, on the last 1 1/2 days of the workshop we want to showcase
popular (Python) software packages for quantum physics.


This workshop is jointy organised by Yuval, Virginia, Alan, and Lachlan, and is funded by the Australian Research Council's
Centre of Engineered Quantum Systems (EQUS).
